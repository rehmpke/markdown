# IE issue

Appears the issue only occurs with IE11 in search box when hitting return. If you hit the magnifying icon search works fine. Or can switch to IE11 compatibility mode. Currently we only have a handful of users on campus using IE11. Most users are using IE10 or Chrome. We could look at have IE11 in compatibility mode however, that might comprise other web pages being access using IE11 on campus.

**Question:** Will there be an upgrade to the current SharePoint in the future?

**Summary:** SharePoint 2010 compatibility issue with IE11
