# Been a searcher for a long time

I believe since the age seven I looked for some outer thing influencing the way things worked in my life. I felt I never had control. I took many routes to find answers.

## the days of my childhood

I always felt I was different as the people in my life told me. I started with a small creative spark and was separated from others when I was a child. I felt the need to draw and see things a little differently by drawing a lot. My grand mother took a interest in me and my father always showed me off with it. I believe that is what pushed me through many hard years as I was small and did not fit in with other kids. I spent my life being very introverted and curious. Of course then they did not have the internet so the only way I saw the light of day with these thoughts was with books. and I really did not read.

I know my grandmother was a strong advocate of my abilities and saw in me early that I should be put in art classes. Which I will be forever grateful to her. We met through a local art supply store a retired art instructor. She took me under her wing and was a good mentor. This lady spent the next several years guiding my drawing and painting abilities. I loved that time of life. I could go to a place and not be judged and just did what I did best. I tended to want to get done with a drawing the same day I started it and that is what she slowed me down for she wanted me to enjoy the process. the time in the craft. It was special we spent many a Saturday in the process and it was special for me. This was the first real mentor in my life and guider. I spent several years gleaning onto skills that seemed very important to me. I learned how to paint and others appreciated my skills. It mad e me happy.

During high school I went through a ruff time and this took a toll on my art. I lost interest because of the other weights on my mind. There were a few teachers who saw what could move me forward and I appreciate their efforts. I was shy and did not quite get what the other kids seemed to naturally understand. Mr. Holmquest an instructor intrigued me. He had a passion for history. I liked that class because I was pushed.

During my summers I worked with my father and grandfather. We built garages and I got to see a different perspective of my grandfather. He tended to be a tuff, tall, strong man. I respected him though I was a bit of an idiot. He helped force me to grow up. One way he would do this was like he always did. He made me think through a practical approach. I remember one unique example. I was walking past the garage we were building. He was standing on the roof. As I passed he told me to catch. I reached out my hand and that is when I saw the hot ember of his cigarette land in my hand. As I noticed it I dropped it and reached for my sore hand. My grandfather said at that moment don't catch anything landing off the top of the roof. I could be killed. That was his way of building some common sense into me.
This kind of solid approach lasted until his death in 1988. He taught me even while he was on his death bed in the hospital directing my with my future as he lay dyeing of Leukemia.

On graduating, I started to find my balance. It would be a long process. I really had no clue as I look back now. I went to Joliet Junior College and had a few instructors mentor me such as my life drawing teacher. I really did not get to many likenesses in that class but I had a passion again and it moved me forward. I dealt with the classes I had to and they were fun.

I then moved on to working age. I remember a job working for a production studio in Chicago. it was great and I got a experience that showed me that I was not really as tuned as I thought. Micky the owner kept saying that I was a great illustrator. this helped me.

I was still lonely.

# The time I met duke

My sister, Valerie, dated this guy Named Paul, I was still shy and during that time when I really did not do art I was pretty much in a pattern of depression. I went with her as this old guy at a ranch asked her to bring me and was interested in me for some reason. I reluctantly went with her as I was not in the best speaking time with her most of my teen years.

I get to this farm like ranch and their were some familiar faces but most seemed foreign. I was timid and very introverted to the point that I was agoraphobic. He was very nice but I was not really there yet in my head. I was interested in the concept that this was a native american group. He notice my doodling one day and that I was not really interacting with the others. They let me be but talked with me a lot. He began with a number of engagements with me trying to get me to talk to him. He shocked me when he asked me if I could paint a painting on the wall of his house. From what I knew about him he was building a huge house and from his appearance I could not figure out how he even could afford it.
