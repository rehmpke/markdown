# Jotform coding into site

## Get code out of Jotform

To get the code out of Jotform we need to hit publish and then click on the link.

Then we click view source and copy and save out to html page.

## Jotform into our code with Jquery

We need to make the code work as it is using $ sign and our jquery is as well which is causing a conflict.
