A [quote from Julia McCoy](https://expresswriters.com/our-top-10-strategies-to-becoming-an-expert-blogger/) in the expresswriters.com site is, 'A blog is just an online journal.'

A place to get Ideas on for a blog can be from comments or things people are asking on social media. Wow I would have never thought about that end of it. great advice. This article says it asked a number of individuals who write what to write about ant that was one of the first things I gleaned. I will try that next. I am going to test that on Twitter and see if I can come up with five ideas for blog articles people want to understand or know better. This is monumental in my opinion, amazing!
