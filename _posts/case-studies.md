# Case Studies



## KCC athletics site redesign
### Developed sliding schedule pulling content from Youtube
The athletics department wanted to show latest videos in a slideshow on their home page. Working with them I used the YouTube api to pull content into the page

`JavaScript`, `Ajax`, `YouTube`
-  One of the main goals was to be performant and not audit poorly in browsers

### Developed schedule using google api as the backend pulling in from a websites rss feed
The current schedule was complicated for Athletics authors

`JavaScript`, `Ajax`, `Google sheets`

## KCC News site
### Pulled content out of SharePoint 2010 site and used various terminal commands and regex to reformat it to YAML Markdown



## Portal enhancements: Enrollment Dashboard on KCC Intranet Portal
Built an Enrollment meter as Enrollment was down in the college and we needed a way for the college's associates to see the progress of enrollment daily. We provided another document for staff members to become evangelists for the college.

`SVG`, `JavaScript`, `SharePoint 2013`

Working with the Marketing director, President, and IT I iterated through a design, mockup and final piece that was used in the portal. Link To a few of these iterations to enrollment meter development in process.

## Streamlined develoment work flow for kcc.edu
KCC's site was at the last legs of it's flayling support. It was leveraging SharePoint 2010. We decided to redesign it using open source technologies as a number of content management solutions were in parallel working similar to our open source model we were suggesting.

- System Architecture & Server Updates


 -  Gulp
 -  Jekyll
 -  Travis CI
 -  CloudCannon

## Landing page redevelopment using static site generators

SharePoint 2010 left a lot to be desired in 2016 but we still were responsible of getting people through our doors at KCC. It made it hard to do the simplest things as it was using html that had its last draft written 16 yrs prior. I saw this as an opportunity to use the Jekyll static site generator to make it modern.

## In an attempt save effort amoungst departments when using a CRM we decided to incorporate a jotform into the landing page for information.

## Rosters and Scholarships
`JavaScript`

Worked to embed and open source solution into the foundation and athletics website.
