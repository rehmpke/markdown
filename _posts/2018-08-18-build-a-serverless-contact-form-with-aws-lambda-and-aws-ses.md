# Building a serverless contact form with AWS Lambda and AWS SES

my portfolio site has had a formspree.io form hooked up to it for the longest time. I am changing that as it first off sends my information through them. Secondly it makes it so I can't really make adjustments to the returned page.

I already had setup a AWS account and have been using it for several months. It is very robust and takes time to get a handle on it.
I am using my root user still which is not safe for anything public so I am going to lock that down.
