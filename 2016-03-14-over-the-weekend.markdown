# Big yard weekend

Saturday morning I get up and in process of getting to my coffee machine, I looked out the window. I see the neighbor outside working in her front yard with her kids. Spring is starting to effect me. I decided to walk out side because it was hot in the house. Next my OCD kicks in and I am in the garage cleaning up the working side of three bays. There is always a huge amount of crap in my garage as my kids just randomly dump stuff there throughout the winter. I start sweeping and then I am out of the garage. Damn, I still did not have my coffee.

Next thing you know I am out in the yard picking up branches. I am loving the fact that my parents gave me their broken down blue wheel barrel. I am going back and forth across the yard when I think ya know if I grab a garbage bag and the picker upper I could get the garbage picked up as well. So I drop everything and go into the house and grab that. I start cleaning up. My daughter got off big let me tell ya.

The day goes by and the yard is done. Wow did not expect that. I just kept pushing through. Sometimes it is like that when I am in the groove. I just loose track of time and myself. I continued by cleaning up the pile of leaves, raking the pine cones, getting the dead stuff out of the day lilies.

I would have gotten mored done but my body just gave out.

## That was Saturday and Sunday began

A little pep talk went a long way. Rachel has been off of work now for three weeks and is bored out of her mind. She decided she was going to clean our bedroom as an effort to say  she did something over her time off. So needless to say a lot of work got done this weekend.

## my phone
I of course was bored so then I started messing with the apps on my phone. cleansing one and then another off of the phone. Then I start reordering them from start to finish. Dear God I am a geek with this stuff. I get that in order then I am on to my next day task list. next thing I notice it is twelve at night and I cannot believe I shot through my weekend again.

## Monday morning I am late for getting up

Yep the time change hit me this morning. I woke up late and jumped out of bed. yelled up to Jordyn as my daughter can't seem to get herself up for high school. I wrangled myself finally and jumped out the door.

I get to work and I am so tired. I don't know how I am going to make it without like six cups of coffee.
