# Meta

Augmented reality is a big buzz word today. Headsets that you wear to allow and individual to see things like butterflies flying about the room. This kind of system lays on top of reality and it does not block out the real world.

I can see this being used in carpentry as well. imagine  in the class as you draw out a plan for a building and your instructor can turn it all over and you can see if you are missing materials. or short on materials. could be as good as nail guns compared to the hammer of old. A carpenter could say I need you to build this and hand his worker a design he pulled together the day before. The carpenter could then see the exact thing and get the information quickly and perform the job exactly and efficiently as it was meant to be done.

I have a theory that the closer things are to contexts we recognize from the real world the easier they become as channels of learning to us. These can become supplementals to learning in lectures and less expensive then actual materials used.

I like the idea and can clearly see a use for it. This will be good for doctors and engineers. As they throw up virtual displays to see things happening in a multitude of environments. things that can be tactile and adjusted on the fly. I see it good for web folks as well as anyone who uses a second or third monitor. get rid of the multitude of screens and lower your costs. Just put on the gear and you can pick as many monitors as needed for the job.

That being said Meta is a company like many others who is developing a headset to use for this new opportunity space. It is catching on quick and I foresee it being the immediate future of technology. We will live in it. and it will be baked into glass and and used in cars. awesome stuff.

## How you can get started quickly

Go to and download a development kit from Meta. The system or headset costs $900.00 and is an amazing investment into the next three years as I see it.

I began my look into it today and will be downloading it soon as well as getting a headset. This is a new frontier and we need to jump into it before it goes over the curve of expert. like the web did. I am going to jump and hold on while looking at other things going on in the monster lab as [Tai Lopez](http://www.tailopez.com) suggests in his videos.

## Where to go next

I need to spend some time looking for a blogging mentor. Today I may try to find one. I also have to grab a hold of my techniques a bit as I write.

I want to get going on this and turn it into an grasped opportunity instead of a one off. I will need to quick as I believe money is not going to mean much as a robot can write an article soon and just take or surpass me on writings.

I am putting into practice what Jack Canfield has suggested as a practice over and over principle while looking for more opportunities. I can't wait to fulfill my abilities to write as well.

Is there a place I can start getting feedback on my writing process as well I wish to glean from those that went forward before me and progress quickly not be stuck holding the bag.

A [quote from Julia McCoy](https://expresswriters.com/our-top-10-strategies-to-becoming-an-expert-blogger/) in the expresswriters.com site is, 'A blog is just an online journal.'

A place to get Ideas on for a blog can be from comments or things people are asking on social media. Wow I would have never thought about that end of it. great advice. This article says it asked a number of individuals who write what to write about ant that was one of the first things I gleaned. I will try that next. I am going to test that on Twitter and see if I can come up with five ideas for blog articles people want to understand or know better. This is monumental in my opinion, amazing!
