## Success Principles with Tai
Today I've watched a video from Tai Lopez. I get a number of emails from him over the last week. I wanted to see if he was scam like so I signed up for his newsletter. He is very prolific and I don't think I will be in for a long hall. I find him interesting as he seems to be doing something right with his branding. I do find it kind of spammy in nature and wonder how long these guys are going to last. That being said, he has some good points on leads and how to get and use them in business. His website is [Tailopez.com](http://tailopez.com). Go check it out with the occasional grain of salt. I [read through a post on google](http://lucrativeonline.com/tai-lopez-fraud-and-scam-artist) you get about the same information if you read through can somethings book and is a lot cheaper at amazon then the 67 that Tai wants you to pay for his program. Again I have nothing wrong with Tai Lopez but check the information out and make your own judgements on the material.

## Animation with SVG
Next I spent some time in [codedrops.com](http://www.codedrops.com) as I am trying to get a handle on my learning with web design and coding. I find they have cutting edge material on their site. I am studying SVG and Illustrator to generate some pretty clever web animations. So far I found that you can do some simple setup. In Illustrator you basically are naming layers and grouping layers. Finally when you are done you just save out with SVG. Then you just open up in your favorite text editor and wallah you have a very familiar xml structure. The article I followed is called [Interactive Infographics with SVG and css animations](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/02/06/interactive-infographic-with-svg-and-css-animations/). Check it out has some good material.

I am trying to build a similar item for KCC so I am working on that kind of thing. I find [support for animation lacking a bit in Microsoft](caniuse.com).

Because of security reasons in chrome. as the article talks about, I spun up a simple server through my terminal on the Mac. CD to the project folder and then did a simple server request from python. This allowed me to see the site on my mac for testing.

I also had to look up `transform-origin` because I was not familiar with the x y origins in the `transform-property`.

[CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/) has a nice article on CSS animation properties as well.

I have begun looking for a good svg animation tool to create some of the code for me as I know the stuff but who really spends a day doing animation by hand. Yipes that is not a good thing.
