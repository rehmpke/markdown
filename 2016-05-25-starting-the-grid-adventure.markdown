## What is the crazy grid thing in CSS

This week I will be working out the grid system as I work to implement flexbox. I have had some good luck with it and figured I would continue the mommentum of the process. I found a simple grid building article and looks neet. I will be doing this as I believe it is the next big hurdle for design on the web. We have been stuck in a rut for a long time design wise. We could and have the opportunity to make print designers say hey they are really doing something cool and want to jump on the band wagon and get this party started.

So my goal for the next week is that I get a full understanding of this grid thing and implement it in something I am working on in the flexbox arena. I want to add some simple transforms to it and make it interesting in how all of it plays together.

I will be adding some links to this post as I go along.
